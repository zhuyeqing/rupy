<title>Rupy - Tiny NIO Application Server</title>
</head>
<body>
Instructions: start {@link se.rupy.http.Daemon}, implement {@link se.rupy.http.Service} then {@link se.rupy.http.Deploy}. Rupy is small but very potent, and it's growing stabler by the version, 0.4.2 is the first build that we can guarantee you can safely use live without anything infront of it.
