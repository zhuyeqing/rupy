This requires latest [rupy](http://rupy.se/rupy.zip) in hosted mode.

For true redundancy you need to use some custom cluster database since we [host](http://host.rupy.se) across multiple colocations!
Ordinary databases are not secure or redundant in a distributed cluster environment out of the box, but most of all:

> _Database clients don't use async HTTP; you can't scale them easily._

On the other hand modern file systems can now index (ext4) and async is becoming common place; See the entry on [FUSE](https://code.google.com/p/rupy/wiki/Fuse) to learn more on how you can scale any [µSOA](https://code.google.com/p/rupy/wiki/Process) cluster with async HTTP.

ROOT takes a little bit from all NoSQL databases: document, key-value and graph; It's basically a key-value store (Base58-JSON) with indexing (that we call sort) on custom fields (including full text search) in the JSON and graph relationships between the key-values.

The JSON objects and indexes are stored as a plain file (symbolic hard link). The relations and full text search are just binary files with lists of longs (the hashed Base58 key). Simple, powerful and in line with both _Moore's_ and _Murphy's_ laws.
